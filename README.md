# CanoB_UCExtension_Py
Final project for :   Python for data Analysis and Scientific Computing
   

Alex:

ZIP file "Brian_cano_project_CSVs.zip" contains:
  one .py code file "BrianCano_finalproject.py" 
  folder with 2 CSVs (raw data) "baseballdatabank_2017"

Place the py code and the folder in the same directory.  
.py code refers to the CSV files with a relative path. 

when your run the .py code file, you will get a user prompt asking if you want to use default values or not.
Easiest thing for you to do is respond 'y' to automatically generate the output 

this is only my second or third time trying GitHub and first time sharing a repository; hope this works!
